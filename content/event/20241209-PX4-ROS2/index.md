abstract: 'PX4 has emerged as one of the most popular community-driven open-source autopilots for Drones. On the other hand, ROS 2 is a set of software libraries and tools for building robot applications and can be seen as the robotics community standard for middleware. In this training, we will present an overview on how to develop and test Control and Navigation Algorithms for Aerial Robots with PX4 and ROS 2.


This workshop and visit were part of the Horizon-Europe AeroSTREAM project.
